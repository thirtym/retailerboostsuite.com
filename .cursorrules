# RetailerBoost Landing Pages - Cursor Rules

## Language & Spelling

- Use **American English** spellings (e.g., "color" not "colour", "optimize" not "optimise", "center" not "centre")
- Use American date formats where applicable (MM/DD/YYYY)

## Code Style

### HTML Structure

- Keep HTML semantic and accessible
- Use descriptive `id` attributes for anchor links (e.g., `id="pricing"`, `id="faq"`)
- Prefer inline styles for one-off styling; use `<style>` blocks for repeated patterns
- Always include `alt` text for images
- Use `rel="noopener"` with `target="_blank"` links

### JavaScript

- Use vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks required for these static pages
- Use `'use strict';` in all script blocks
- Prefer `var` for browser compatibility (no transpilation)
- Use IIFEs to avoid polluting global scope
- Add clear comments explaining what scripts do (especially tracking scripts)

### CSS

- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for colors when adding new styles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Prefer `rem` units for typography, `px` for borders/shadows
- Use `rgba()` for semi-transparent backgrounds

## Components & Modularity

- Extract repeated HTML patterns into clearly commented sections
- Use consistent naming conventions for CSS classes
- Group related content into `<section>` elements with descriptive comments
- Keep FAQ items in a consistent structure for easy additions

## Content Guidelines

### Tone (from README.md)

- Confident, calm, senior
- No hype, no buzzwords
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Short paragraphs, clear sections

### Messaging Do's

- "Incremental sales" - every sale we generate is a sale that wasn't happening before
- "We fund the ad spend, you keep the client relationship"
- "No sales = no charge"
- "We're ad spend investors, not an agency"
- "You're in control"

### Messaging Don'ts

- Avoid "growth hack", "unlock", "revolutionary"
- Avoid "guaranteed results"
- Avoid anything suggesting we compete with agencies
- Avoid anything suggesting we want the client relationship

### Emojis

- **Limit emoji use** - only where they add genuine clarity or visual hierarchy
- Prefer icons or visual design over emojis for UI elements
- If emojis are used, keep them subtle and professional

## Typography

- Use dashes (`-`) not em dashes (`—`) for consistency
- Use `<strong>` for emphasis, not `<b>`
- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)

## Links & CTAs

### Signup Links

- All signup CTAs should use `data-signup` attribute for UTM tracking
- Always include `target="_blank" rel="noopener"` for external links
- The UTM handler script will dynamically set the correct href

```html
<a href="https://app.retailerboost.com/signup" data-signup="location-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  Get Started
</a>
```

### Calendly Links

- Use the `openCalendly()` helper function which passes UTM params automatically:

```html
<a href="#" onclick="openCalendly('calendly-location');return false;">
  Book a Call
</a>
```

- The location identifier (e.g., `calendly-nav`, `calendly-hero`, `calendly-faq`, `calendly-footer`) becomes the `utm_content` fallback value
- Incoming UTM params from the page URL are automatically passed to Calendly

## Tracking Scripts

### Order of Scripts

1. Google Tag Manager (in `<head>`)
2. RB2B tracking (in `<head>`)
3. UTM parameter handler (in `<head>`)
4. Calendly widget (before `</body>`)
5. Signup attribution tracking (before `</body>`)

### Adding New Tracking

- Add clear comments explaining what the script does
- Note if it's for ad tracking vs signup attribution (these are different!)
- Test that scripts don't block page rendering
