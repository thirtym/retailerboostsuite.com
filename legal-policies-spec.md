## Terms & Conditions

**Page Title:** Terms & Conditions | RetailerBoost  
**Meta Description:** Terms and conditions for using RetailerBoost's performance-based Google Shopping Ads service.  
**Last Updated:** November 26, 2025

### Content

#### 1. PARTIES AND INTRODUCTION

1.1 RetailerBoost (a 30m.com company) owns and operates a performance-based Google Shopping Ads service which enables RetailerBoost to create and manage Google Shopping Ads campaigns to advertise the Merchant's products.

1.2 Merchant (who has approved the RetailerBoost Commission and accepted these terms (collectively, this "Agreement") before signing up for the service), offers all of its products for sale to prospective customers via RetailerBoost's Google Shopping Ads campaigns.

1.3 This Agreement forms the basis upon which RetailerBoost and Merchant agree to cooperate to advertise, promote, market and sell products to Customers through RetailerBoost Google Shopping Ads campaigns and for the Merchant to pay commission to RetailerBoost on amounts associated with such sales ('RetailerBoost Commission') calculated on subtotal basket value and on Sales Before Returns and based on a 30 day cookie window Last Non-Direct Click Attribution Model. Merchant is not charged commission on shipping costs (or any US sales tax, or other local, state or federal tax that Merchant is obligated to collect on the order within the US). The default commission rate factors in an average returns rate, meaning that commission is charged on all orders irrespective of returns/cancellations that are made after the transaction is complete. As a result of the original sale, the Merchant has the contact details of the customer so they can re-market to the customer, so even if an item is returned/cancelled, there is still intrinsic value to the transaction.

1.4 Commission Rate Adjustments - The default commission rate is set at 12%. Any adjustments to this commission rate must be mutually agreed upon between RetailerBoost and the Merchant. The Merchant may request changes to the commission rate used to calculate charges in writing, and no changes will be made without the explicit consent of the Merchant. RetailerBoost will manage its ad spend to ensure the sustainability of the service and will not pass on losses incurred from advertising spend to the Merchant.

1.5 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the minimum commission charge processed by RetailerBoost will be $0.03. In cases where the calculated commission charge is less than this minimum amount, the charge will be rounded up to $0.03. This minimum charge is in place to cover various operational costs, including but not limited to payment processing fees and regulatory fees.

1.6 This Agreement sets out the parties' respective rights and obligations in respect of providing a service to advertise, promote, market and sell products to Customers through RetailerBoost Google Shopping Ads campaigns.
